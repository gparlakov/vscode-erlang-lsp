# vscode-erlang-lsp README

This VSCode extension is interacting with an Erlang language server that provides support for the language. 
To begin with, this is meant to be a testbed for the server and there will be few (if any) other features (like syntax highlighting or executing code). There are other extension that provide those.
 
The server  will initially be part of this repository (in the `server` directory), but will later become a standalone entity (probably under the "erlide" brand).
